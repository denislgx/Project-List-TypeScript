My first TypeScript Project! It's a Project List with a form to create projects and two boxes -Active and Finished Projects- to drag and drop them where they belong!

In order to run the app follow the next steps:

1) Donwload or clone the repository.
2) Run "npm install" at the root directory in the terminal.
3) Run "npm start" at the root directory in the terminal.
4) Open your browser at http://localhost:8080/.

It's a pure TypeScript project (and Webpack) with an OOP approach.
