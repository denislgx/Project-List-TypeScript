My first TypeScript Project! It's a Project List with a form to create the projects and  two boxes -Active and Finished Projects- to drag and drop them where they belong!

In order to run the app follow the next steps:

1) Donwload or clone the repository.
2) Run "npm install" at the root directory in the terminal.
3) Run "npm start" at the root directory in the terminal and the project will open in your default browser!

It's a pure TypeScript Project (with no third party libraries used except for lite-server for running purposes) with and OOP approach.
